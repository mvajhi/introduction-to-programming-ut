Let buffer[10] and numbers[11] and n and number and swap
Get n (under 11)
For i from 0 to n - 1 (add 1 each repeat)
    Get buffer[i]
Get number
For i from 0 to n - 1 (add 1 each repeat)
    numbers[i] equal buffer[i]
numbers[n] equal number

For i from 0 to n - 1 (add 1 each repeat)
    For j from 0 to n - c - 1 (add 1 each repeat)
        If numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]
            swap = numbers[j]
            numbers[j] = numbers[j + 1]
            numbers[j + 1] = swap

For i from 0 to n (add 1 each repeat)
    Print numbers[i]
